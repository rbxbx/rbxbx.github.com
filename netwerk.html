# Netwerkin' 4 fun n profit

---

# Agenda

## may or may not be an accurate ordering, like UDP

* Protocols
* TCP
* UDP
* PACKETS
* TCPDUMP
* ERRATA

---

# PROTOCOLZZZ

A protocol is just a set of rules that determine the format and meaning of frames/messages/packets sent between
servers and clients

---

# TCP

## Transmission Control Protocol

A "connection-oriented" protocol that computers communicate over the internet/network with
TCP has error-checking and guarantees around delivery of data and that packets will be delivered in the order set

---

# UDP

## User Datagram Protocol

A "connectionless" protocol that works like TCP but makes no guarantees around error checking and recovery
It instead continiously sends datagrams (aka ~packets w/o guarantees) to the recepient regardless of receipt

---

# Packets

A packet is a small chunk of data sent over the network with has a header and a payload

This is roughly analogous to a real life package. Your header contains sender and recipient IP addresses (and a few more things) and your payload contains the actual chunk of data (between 1.5kb and 64kb, depending!)

---

# Connection v Connectionless

UDP will just spam whatever you point it at without ensuring that there's anything at the other end
Whereas TCP performs a 3 way handshake first and will disconnect if the client disappears (eventually).

## SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK

This is the 3 way handshake!

_SYN_chronize, _SYN_chronize_ACK_nowledgement, _ACK_nowledge

(host a, host b, host a)

A connection is now established!

---

# what use for?

Basically TCP is more useful where reliability is paramount (http, ssh, smtp, et al)

UDP is useful where speed is key (games, streams, DNS, etc)

---

# TCPDUMP

So that preamble brings us to why we're actually here, `tcpdump`.

tcpdump is a *nix utility that is very likely on your computer if you're running any *nix-like (linux, mac osx)

It essentially allows you to create "dumps" or "traces" of network activity.

## DEMO TIME (oh no)

`tcpdump`

`tcpdump -n`

`tcpdump -n -v(vv)`

`tcpdump -c`

`tcpdump -i`

`tcpdump -w and tcpdump -r`

note: wireshark and some other networking tools can open pcap dumps! They may or may not be friendlier / more intuitive.

---

# Filters

Seeing all network traffic is nice and all, but usually we care about specific bits of data. Filters allow us to accomplish this.

---

## Host / Port

`tcpdump -n -vvv -c 100 -i any host 127.0.0.1`

`tcpdump -n -vvv -c 100 -i any port 3000`

`tcpdump -n -vvv -c 100 -i any host 127.0.0.1 and port 3000`

`tcpdump -n -vvv -c 100 -i any host 127.0.0.1 and (port 3000 or port 4000)`

---

# Making Sense of Things (TM)

## FLAGSSSSSSzzz (flags)

[S] - SYN (Start Connection)

[S.] - SYN-ACK (depending on version)

[.] - No Flag Set

[P] - PSH (Push Data)

[F] - FIN (Finish Connection)

[R] - RST (Reset Connection)

---

# omg so hard 2 read ;_;

## -XX, -A

-XX hex and ascii

-A ascii only

---

# yyyyy?

Often times it can be useful to see your data flowing through the application
_before_ it hits the application layer.

your webserver/webapp/etc tend to do all sorts of things to data that can
obfuscate issues that lie (perhaps) outside the application layer.

---

# THX, NO QUESTIONS

jk but I probably don't have a good answer

####### ... maybe, I just paid an overdue invoice to my domain regristrar so the DNS hasn't refreshed yet
