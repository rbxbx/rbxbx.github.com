<p>There are two things that immediately strike me as problematic when trying to talk to you (dear reader audience), and those are as such: ego and confidence. Perhaps with more concision that could be said as solely confidence. </p>

<p>I need to feel good about what I&#8217;m saying to you personally, which I seldom do. I often reflect fondly upon things I&#8217;ve done or said or created in the past, but seldom at the moment (and the times I do, tend to be with crafts I&#8217;m more practiced in, writing not being one of them). So, here is an open effort to disregard that inkling of stfu that&#8217;s lurking back there.</p>

<p>Second, and more importantly (and perhaps encompassing the first) is confidence. I don&#8217;t know about you, but myself, as a student of all things and everything, am very seldom confident in&#8230; well, anything. Right? It would be foolish to be so. There are so many (brilliant) people out there, doing so many (brilliant) things, that are on levels that I can only begin to grasp, why should I think that anything I do is actually correct? (or even approaching being as such).</p>

<p>Perhaps the problem is even simpler than ego and confidence, it&#8217;s an issue of respect really. If you&#8217;re going to read what I&#8217;m putting forth here, it should be worth your time. When it&#8217;s something brief and obviously helpful (ie: found this in a google search, thanks bro!) then yes, I can justify breathing these words in front of you, when it&#8217;s me waxing philosophically about my current understanding of software (development), then it&#8217;s MUCH LESS OBVIOUSLY SO, to me.</p>

<p>From here on out I&#8217;m going to assume what I have to say matters with the hopes that one day it does. Sorry in the meantime, but I hope when we&#8217;re approaching the end of our journey you&#8217;ll forgive me (and that I&#8217;ve produced something of value to you).</p>

<p>TLDR: Fuck it, I need to brush up on my prose. (Also, wtf, c&#8217;mon, someone has to listen to me. You like hearing about monads from someone who doesn&#8217;t have a cs degree and hearing about life from someone who can&#8217;t figure it out, right?) </p>

<p>(ending with a statement in parens is pretty lacking in <strong>emphasis</strong>)</p>
